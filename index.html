                    <p class="text-left">The capital cost of making electric vehicles would be on a par with petrol/diesel vehicles in five years and India would be importing electric vehicles if it does not develop the ecosystem, said Ashok Jhunjhunwala, Principal Advisor, Ministry of Power & New and Renewable Energy, Government of India.<br>

                       “Electric vehicles will be the future of transportation in the country. They have significantly higher energy efficiency when compared to petrol/diesel vehicles and can be more reliable going forward,” he said speaking at the Freedom Talk on ‘Role of Digitisation and ECommerce in Indian Economic Growth’ organised by TANSTIA-FNF Service Centre (TFSC) and Friedrich- Naumann-Stiftung für die Freiheit.
                       
                       Mr. Jhunjhunwala also noted with the battery prices falling, electric vehicles would be most sought after in the next 5-6 years, and warned that if India waited till that time, it would end up importing electric vehicles instead of oil.</p>

                   <p>The US Presidential elections are both clumsy and complex. There are popular votes and there is the electoral college. Votes of 271 electors are required to win the Presidency and a candidate can win or lose in popular votes but that may not matter. While popular votes are counted in November, the electors meet in state capitals a month later.
                        <br>
                       In the last Presidential election in 2016, Donald Trump lost to Hillary Clinton in popular votes but went on to secure the support of 306 of the 538 members of the electoral college. This had happened before, the last time in 2000 when Al Gore lost narrowly to George Bush.And if the 2016 presidential election was nasty, the election in 2020 promises to be nastier. If the last Presidential election was marred by charges of rigging and interference by Russia backed agencies, this year’s election promises to be more vicious, more chaotic and with a large number of Americans likely to vote through postal ballots in view of the pandemic.
